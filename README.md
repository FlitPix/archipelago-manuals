# Archipelago Manuals

This repository houses all Archipelago Manual APWorlds ("manuals" going forward) that I've created.

## List of games

- [ESCHATOS](https://github.com/FlitPix/archipelago-manuals/releases?q=ESCHATOS) (Steam, NS, PC, XB360)

## How to use

Manual APWorlds may be installed like any other unsupported game:
- Download the .apworld file from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FlitPix/archipelago-manuals/releases) and place them in your Archipelago directory's `custom_worlds` subdirectory (create it if it doesn't exist).
  - You can also use silasary's [APWorld Manager](https://github.com/silasary/Archipelago/releases?q=Manager).
- Once installed, you may Generate Template Options in the AP Launcher to create a template YAML. The host can then use it to [generate a multiplayer game](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en#generating-a-multiplayer-game).

To connect to the multiworld, you use the Manual Client. Once connected, the interface can easily be used to send checks. It's recommended that you also install [Universal Tracker](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases?q=Tracker), as Manual has direct integration with it to show you what's in logic.

## Support

If you encounter an issue with my manual implementations, please create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FlitPix/archipelago-manuals/issues).

If you encounter an issue with the Manual client or have any questions regarding Archipelago Manual games, please ask in the [Manual Discord server](https://discord.gg/T5bcsVHByx).
