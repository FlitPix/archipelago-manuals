# ESCHATOS (Steam, PS4, NS, XB360)

[ESCHATOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatos) is a vertical shmup released in 2011 for the Xbox 360 in Japan. It was later released worldwide on Steam in 2015, and on Nintendo Switch and PS4 in 2022.

If you already knew about this game, it's probably because of its awesome arcade-inspired soundtrack which was composed by Yousuke Yasui. [Go get it!!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/396910/ESCHATOS_Original_Soundtrack_Steam_Edition/)

## How to play

This manual is built primarily with syncs in mind. It can also be played in asyncs, but since ESCHATOS lacks an AREA Select screen, you'll need to replay AREAs you've already cleared.

You may play in either Original or Advanced mode on any difficulty level (sans Endless). Clearing each AREA is a check. Goal is beating the game by defeating the final boss in AREA 26; sending the location `AREA 26 Clear` will also send goal.

Access Card items, named after the primary tracks of each subsequent region, block progression. You are expected to pause the game after the final AREA of each region and wait for the Access Card. The following Access Cards are required:

- Access Card - "SURVIVE" is required to progress past AREA 5.
- Access Card - "POINT OF NO RETURN" is required to progress past AREA 11.
- Access Card - "STELLAR LIGHT" is required to progress past AREA 15.
- Access Card - "RUSH INTO" is required to progress past AREA 20.
- Access Card - "UNKNOWN PULSE" is required to progress past AREA 23 (go mode).

## TODO
