# ESCHATOS Manual

## What is a Manual game?
A Manual game is a custom game with a set item list and location list, where you'll manually mark locations checked and manually restrict what items you use based on what you've been sent. This makes it so that any game can be included in a multiworld game.

## How do I install the mod for a Manual game?
You don't. There is no mod. The tasks of marking locations as checked and limiting your items used based on items received is all performed by you (the player) while using the Manual client and its accompanying tracker.

## Where is the settings page?
The player settings page for this game is located <a href="../player-settings">here</a>. It contains all the options
you need to configure and export a config file.

## What is the goal of ESCHATOS when randomized?
Your goal is to defeat the final boss in AREA 26.

## What does randomization do to this game?
Access Card items, named after the primary tracks of each subsequent region, block progression. You are expected to pause the game after the final AREA of each region and wait until you receive the Access Card. The following Access Cards are required:

- `Access Card - "SURVIVE"` is required to progress past AREA 5.
- `Access Card - "POINT OF NO RETURN"` is required to progress past AREA 11.
- `Access Card - "STELLAR LIGHT"` is required to progress past AREA 15.
- `Access Card - "RUSH INTO"` is required to progress past AREA 20.
- `Access Card - "UNKNOWN PULSE"` is required to progress past AREA 23 (go mode).

## What is considered a location check in ESCHATOS?
Clearing an AREA is a location check.
