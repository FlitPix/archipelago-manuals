## How to play

Do NOT play this in syncs, for the love of Arceus. Asyncs only. I mean it.

This manual involves you catching one of every Pokémon! It assumes you have enough Pokémon games to do this on your own or as a group.

You can use any Pokémon game you want, even spinoffs! Each species has an Unlock item that unlocks it, except for groups of Legendary Pokémon where each group will have an Unlock (eg. Hoenn Legendaries Unlock, Scarlet Paradoxes Unlock).

Goal is to catch every Pokémon listed in the check list. You can choose whether to include certain kinds of Pokémon, particularly those only available in a few games, event-only, Mythicals, Legendaries, etc. in your YAML settings.

## Note on update cadence

Newly-released games will not be added to this APWorld for at least a month's time to prevent spoilers, regardless of whether they include new Pokémon or whether they're remakes/remasters.

## TODO

- Add game filters (time-consuming, requires knowledge on hooks)
- Add hardware filters (eg. OG DS for Gen 4 dual-slot; requires knowledge on hooks)
